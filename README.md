Udacity Nanodegree Front-End Web Developer, Landing Page.

This project consist to build a Landing Page, using JavaScript, and change when necessary the index.html file, and the style.css file.

In the project I've used many things that Udacity taught me, like the functions, the for ..of loop and more!

I hope I've done a good job, and I would like to thank Udacity and its instructors and mentors for help the people to achieve them goals.

Moreover I appreciate the community. It's really full of other developers that help you with whatever problems.
